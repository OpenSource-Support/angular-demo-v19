# Jest Migration Summary

## What was done

Successfully migrated your Angular project from Karma and Jasmine to Jest as the testing framework.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package.json Updates
- **Removed**: Karma and Jasmine dependencies
  - `@types/jasmine`
  - `jasmine-core`
  - `karma`
  - `karma-chrome-launcher`
  - `karma-coverage`
  - `karma-jasmine`
  - `karma-jasmine-html-reporter`

- **Added**: Jest dependencies
  - `@types/jest`
  - `jest`
  - `jest-environment-jsdom`
  - `jest-preset-angular`
  - `@angular/platform-browser-dynamic` (required for testing)

### 2. Script Updates
- Updated `test` script to use `jest`
- Added `test:watch` script for watch mode
- Added `test:coverage` script for coverage reports

### 3. Configuration Files

#### New Files Created:
- `jest.config.js` - Main Jest configuration
- `setup-jest.ts` - Jest setup file with Angular-specific configuration

#### Modified Files:
- `tsconfig.spec.json` - Updated to use Jest types instead of Jasmine
- `angular.json` - Removed Karma test configuration

### 4. Jest Configuration Features
- Uses `jest-preset-angular` for Angular-specific transformations
- Configured to ignore `dist/` and `out-tsc/` directories
- Set up code coverage collection for TypeScript files
- Configured module name mapping for path aliases
- Proper transform patterns for Angular and RxJS modules

## Available Commands

- `npm test` - Run tests once
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

## Test Results

âœ… All existing tests are passing:
- App component creation test
- Title rendering test

## Coverage Output

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory with:
- HTML reports
- Text summary
- LCOV format for CI integration

## Notes

- The project is using Angular 20 (next version) which required using `--legacy-peer-deps` for some package installations
- There are some deprecation warnings that don't affect functionality
- The existing test structure and assertions remain unchanged - only the testing framework has been switched

Your Angular project is now successfully using Jest instead of Karma and Jasmine!
